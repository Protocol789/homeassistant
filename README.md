## AirtelTracker
AirtelTracker is shell script for accessing data bundle balances for your 4G router plan into Home Assistant. 
The script is then called from a `command_line` sensor in Home Assitant which periocally runs on a scan interval.  
The balance is then exposed for use in dashboarding and graphing in Home Assistant
